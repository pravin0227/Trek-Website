You can go through trains, bus or bike/car,<br>
 it's up to you what you choose, also it depends<br>
  if you planning with friends or family or alone.<br>
  <br>
I opted for a night trek and boarded a 9:35<br> 
pm Kasara Fast Local from Thane Station <br>
 same can be boarded from CST at 8:50 pm <br>
 From there onwards, I was transferred to<br>
  the base village Bari by a taxi or van. <br>

        <p><strong>Q. Is one day enough for Matheran?</strong><br><br>

       <strong> Q.Is Rajmachi Trek safe?</strong><br>
     <br>Precaution to be taken at Rajmachi: <br>
     Do not go for this trek alone. There have<br>
      been few cases of armed robbery on the way<br>
       to Rajmachi from Lonavala, as the road <br>
       travels through jungle and is often empty.<br>
        It will be safe to travel in a group of at<br>
         least 3 and more<br><br>
     <strong>Q. How can I go to Rajmachi?</strong><br>
Lonavala is nearest railway station to reach <br>
Rajmachi fort. Once you are at<br>
    Lonavala station you can hire a taxi or private<br>
     cab to reach Rajmachi fort<br>

       <p> <strong> Q. How many steps are there in Pratapgad?</strong><br>
        To get to this fort, you need to climb like<br>
         450-500 steps. And mind you, these are steps<br>
          with decent height. So a strict no for older folks.<br>
           There is this 'Bhavani mata' temple on 200 steps which<br>
            is worth going<br><br>
            <strong> built Pratapgad?</strong><br>
            This is the video of Pratapgad Fort, Mahabaleshwar,<br>
